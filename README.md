Files for animated GFC plot. Output is an mp4 file.  Data is sourced from St Louis Federal Reserve FRED (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) . Various .csv data files attached in main branch and also the .py file contains the code to produce the animated plot. I used ChatGPT for much of the code . 

Data files are as follows:

* case_pc.psv. :  Us house price index, Case Shiller monthly % change 
* US_unemployment.csv : US Unemployment rate
* fed_funds_rate.csv :  Fed funds effective rate
